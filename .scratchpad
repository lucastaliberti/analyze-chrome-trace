# Current Task
Modify the CrUX data conversion script to:
1. Accept output file path as a parameter
2. Support appending to existing file
3. Update existing URL data if present
4. Add Status column based on metric thresholds
5. Group data by metrics with empty lines between sections
6. Show period as "Month Week#" format

## Progress Tracking
[X] Create a new file to handle the JSON to TSV conversion
[X] Parse and extract relevant metrics data
[X] Format dates as Month Week# (e.g., "Jan 1")
[X] Generate TSV output with proper headers
[X] Add command line argument handling
[X] Implement file writing functionality
[X] Add output file parameter
[X] Implement file appending/updating logic
[X] Add Status column based on metric thresholds
[X] Implement metric grouping with separators
[X] Simplify date representation
[ ] Test the code with the provided sample data

## Notes and Observations
- Data contains three main metrics in order:
  1. largest_contentful_paint (LCP)
    - Good: ≤ 2.5s (2500ms)
    - Needs Improvement: 2.5s-4s
    - Poor: > 4s
  2. interaction_to_next_paint (INP)
    - Good: ≤ 200ms
    - Needs Improvement: 200-500ms
    - Poor: > 500ms
  3. cumulative_layout_shift (CLS)
    - Good: ≤ 0.1
    - Needs Improvement: 0.1-0.25
    - Poor: > 0.25
- Each metric has histogram data and percentile data
- Collection periods are weekly
- Data is grouped by metric type with empty lines between sections
- Metrics are output in a consistent order matching the Chrome UX Report
- Period format is now "Month Week#" (e.g., "Jan 1", "Feb 3")
- Need to handle:
  - Reading existing TSV file if it exists
  - Updating data for existing URLs
  - Appending new URL data
  - Creating new file if it doesn't exist
  - Maintaining metric grouping when updating

## Next Steps
1. Test with sample data
2. Verify Status categorization matches Chrome UX Report
3. Test with multiple URLs and updates
4. Verify metric grouping and spacing
5. Verify week calculation is accurate

- Added command line argument handling
- Implemented file reading and writing with error handling
- Added progress logging
- Added Status column with proper thresholds
- Implemented metric grouping with separators
- Added consistent metric ordering
- Simplified date representation to Month Week# format
